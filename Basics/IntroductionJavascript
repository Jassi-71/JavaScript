JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for web development. It enables developers to create interactive and dynamic features on websites, such as forms, animations, real-time updates, and more.

Role in Web Development
JavaScript is a key technology in web development and plays the following roles:

Client-Side Scripting:
Runs directly in the browser.
Handles user interactions like button clicks, form validation, and animations.
Example: Validating a login form before submission.

Dynamic Content:
Modifies web pages in real time without reloading (DOM manipulation).
Example: Showing a "Thank You" message after a successful form submission.

Backend Development:
With frameworks like Node.js, JavaScript is also used for server-side scripting.
Handles API creation, database operations, and server logic.

Cross-Platform Development:
Tools like React Native enable developers to create mobile apps using JavaScript.
Example: Cross-platform apps for both iOS and Android.

Frameworks and Libraries:
JavaScript has a rich ecosystem, including React.js, Angular, Vue.js for frontend, and Express.js for backend development.
